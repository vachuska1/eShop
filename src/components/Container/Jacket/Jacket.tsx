          Not only is our Tour Jacket pattern
          <br /> based on the classic 1950â€™s-'60s
          <br /> mechanic jacket, but the hand-drawn
          <br /> artwork print that lines the inside was
          <br /> influenced by the same era. The 'Aloha'
          <br /> style drawings were inspired by
          <br /> vintage Hawaiian radio & postcards
          <br /> from our Creative Director's personal
          <br /> collection.
